# Design Like a Pro Review

This is a review of Mark Miller's Course (Design Like a Pro)

* [Interesting Points of the Course](#interesting-points-of-the-course)
* [What was surprising](#what-was-surprising)
* [What Mark Miller did well](#what-mark-miller-did-well)
* [What could have been done better](#what-could-have-been-done-better)
* [Purchase the Course](#purchase-the-course)

## Interesting Points of the Course

* An interesting fact of the course is how much proximity plays a role with UI.
* If elements of a UI are placed in close proximity, users typically assume they are related

**So if you should group related items in a UI in close proximity**

### Contrast

* Contrast is also important in UI
  * For example if you hover a button the contrast should be small not large

### Proximity

{{< figure src="/media/gas-station-buttons.jpeg" >}}

* In this picture notice that the label of the Gas Type is inside the button
* Mark Miller explains that having the element in close proximity to the action is key

{{< figure src="/media/elevator-buttons.jpg" >}}

* Notice that in this picture the proximity and the layout of the buttons in the elevator are confusing

### Borders

* Another interesting point made is about Borders
  * Borders Contrast should be low and should be thin

{{< figure src="/media/bad-html-table.jpg" >}}

* Notice that in this table borders are rubbing up next to each other
* The lines are more prominent and the actual data is hard to extract

{{< figure src="/media/nicer-html-table.png" >}}

* In this table the borders are thin and the table is much easier to read

### Controls

* Another point of the course talks about controls
* Users don't read tons of text if you have to present information then consider a tooltip

### Text

* There was a section detailing how text can confuse dyslexic readers
* This really goes hand and hand with modern web accesibility design
* If you design UIs with users that may have disabilities in mind then general readers benefit

My key takeaways for text:

1. Don't use black and white instead use gray and off-white
2. Use concise sentences instead of long paragraphs.
3. Increase Padding in between paragraphs.
4. Left-justify text
5. Use single spaces after sentences and never double space

### Information Dimension

| Serial (through time) | Parallel (in space) |
| --- | --- |
| Takes longer to consume | Evaluated instantly |
| Comparisons are hard | Comparisons are easy |
| Burden on recall | No burden on recall |
| Pacing Issues | Viewer controls Pace |
| Harder to Understand | Easier to Understand |

As you can see from the table above it is easier to present information in parallel over serial to users

### Graphic Language

* Match known physical items to make symbols easier to read
* Graphic Language should be independent of color
* There should be consistency of colors

{{< figure src="/media/olympic-graphics.jpg" >}}

**Notice here in both the simplicity of the icons but the clarity in their message**

* You can clearly tell each sport in each graphic

## What was surprising

* I was surprised to learn that simplicity of design seems to be the hardest thing to get right
* Fancy effects don't provide as much value as clarity of intent
* Accomodating to users with disabilities improves overall design
* Proximity of elements natural groups elements so you have to get the right proximity

## What Mark Miller did well

* Mark Miller know how to clearly explain key design principles that help you build great UIs
* The course is rich with imagery and clear examples on what constitutes good UIs
* There is also a great transition from the Science of Great UI course
  * Incremental steps on each course help facilitate key design points

## What could have been done better

* There wasn't any mention of using Sketch app and instead Adobe Creative Cloud was heavily used
* It would be great to mention tools like Sketch and Omnigraffle
* More opinions on using design tools would be nice although it might detract from the course intent

**Overall this course is wonderfully crafted, job well done**
