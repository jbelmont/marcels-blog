## About Papers We Love

* What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved?

* What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? 

* Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers.

* Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just gives other members a proper rundown about the paper.

* Try to come to each session with an open mind, listen, discuss, and learn.
