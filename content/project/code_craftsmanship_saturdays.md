## Code Craftsmanship Saturdays

* Code Craftsmanship Saturdays is a meetup group where people can learn and practice both new and old technologies in an informal environment. 
* People learn best when paired in groups where they can share different ideas, thoughts, and approaches to problems. 
* This group is heavily influenced from the Node School Organization, but is intended to be more generic in content.
* This code retreat is about practice, not about delivering a product on a deadline. 
* We will follow the format of a code retreat but the meetups will only be 4 hours long. 
* Start now, try something new, get the fire back, the reason you started coding in the first place!
